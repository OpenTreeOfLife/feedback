feedback
========

No code here, just an issue tracker for general feedback from project websites, apps, and API users.

https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/feedback/issues

Most feedback will be sent here via GitHub's [issues API](http://developer.github.com/v3/issues/). For a basic Feedback form, this might be simple a text body, but in most cases it will already be "qualified" with labels, milestones, and specially formatted tags for easy searching.

This gives the project team a single, visible place to respond to feedback. For most users, this could be overwhelming, but the issues API will allow us to display messages (including reply chains) within the relevant sites and apps.
